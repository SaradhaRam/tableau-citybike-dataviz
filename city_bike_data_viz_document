2.Finding Age Group: The dataset doesnot have the age group details. I uncover the deatils by creating the calculated field for the age group 
using if-else conditions. 
IF (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) >= 15 AND (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) < 24  THEN "Age 15-24"
ELSEIF (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) > 25 AND (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) < 34  THEN "Age 25-34"
ELSEIF (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) > 35 AND (INT(2016)- INT([Birth Year])) < 44  THEN "Age 35-44"
ELSEIF (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) > 45 AND (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) < 54  THEN "Age 45-54"
ELSEIF (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) > 55 AND (INT(2016) - INT([Birth Year])) < 64  THEN "Age 55-64"
ELSE "Other"
END  
using the Age group partition I have calculated the Average trip duration by Age group and Number of trips by age group. 

3. Finding days form given data: Split the month from the year using DatePart() method and using DateName() method split the weekdays.
DATENAME("weekday",[Start Time])
DATENAME('month',[Start Time])
After uncovering the Days I can find the longest trip during the week. That is Saturday and Sunday, and the Popular months are June, July and August.
Because the number of trip take dring those months are greate than the remaining months.
